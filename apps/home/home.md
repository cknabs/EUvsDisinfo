# Exploring the EUvsDisinfo Database

[EUvsDisinfo](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/) is an initiative of the EU East Stratcom Taskforce, that monitors, collects, and classifies examples of disinformation campaigns originating in the Russian Federation and affecting European countries.

Since 2015, EUvsDisinfo maintains a [database of published disinformation](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/), including manual annotations, summaries, and disproof for each entry.
While the database contains a trove of information on disinformation campaigns in europe during the past decade, I found it hard to make sense of this huge list of over 10'000 entries.

That's why I started the personal project of trying to visualize and analyze this database!

On this website, I [explore and visualize](/visualization) of the database in order to gain more intuition about the data.
I also show some [analysis](/analysis), where I try to uncover and show deeper trends within the data.
You can find the original data on the [EUvsDisinfo.eu](https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/), and the code behind this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/cknabs/EUvsDisinfo).
